NEXT STEPS:

TO DO IN BRAZIL:
- Code vesion graphs as organizational elements in the left tree
- Code awareness of older/new version selected (arrows up and down)
- Performance optimizations
- publisher/subscriber model for the CM notification

BUGS TO FIX:
- Repository class can not assume sequential configuration (no?).
- When I delete a directory the ArchTrace do not represent the next configuration without the directory
- The check-in with a delete is not returning the next configuration number...
- It is locking after a check-out/check-in...

IDEAS:
- Increase awareness related to policy messages
- Define the type of the trace (requirements, source-code, etc.)
- Put some awareness informing if all traces are related to the same configuration (necessary condition to perform check-out)
